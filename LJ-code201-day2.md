# LJ Code 201 - Day 100

Today we worked on a number of things. I am still struggling with learning the different functions of the console. I feel I am really slow but our TA Chris has been a huge help in keeping me upto date with the class. I am hoping as days go by I will be more independent in figuring things out.

I really enjoyed the code review and learning the different coding examples in class. That was a great way to learn.
