Today I learned about the different ways images can be used to enhance the layout and design in CSS. I found it really interesting that there are so many ways one can manipulate the background image in an HTML document such as the background-repeat property which can have four values - repeat, repeat-x, repeat-y, no-repeat. I also learned the concept of a 'sprite' which is when a single image is used for different parts of an interface, it is known as a sprite. In addition, I leared that touch screen devices will not change a link's state when the user hovers over it as the screens do not yet have a way to tell when the user is hovering.
