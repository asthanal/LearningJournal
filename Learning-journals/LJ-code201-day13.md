#                          Learning Journal - Day 13
I enjoyed reading the article "What Google learned from its quest to build the perfect team". I felt that Project Aristotle was a very interesting exercise for Google to undertake to understand what makes a team successful over another. I came away with a couple of take aways from my reading. Firstly the fact that for a team to be successful it didn't matter if it appeared inefficient to an outsider as team members would joke around or go off topic. What mattered was that everyone got an approximately equal amount of say and was listened to and respected by all the team members. The concept of 'psychological safety' was interesting as one needed to feel secured in one's team. I believe that to work in a successful team communication is key where one is both a good communicator as well as a good listener. It is important to go beyond the team goals and understand each other's personality and life, to feel truly connected and having the same goals of team success.
