Today I learned about the various ways forms can be used in JavaScript. It was interesting to learn about the different types of form controls such as adding text though text input, password input, text area, making choices through radio buttons, checkboxes and drop down boxes and submitting forms though submit buttons,image buttons and file upload. I was intrigued by the concept of a hidden form contol which allow web page authors to gether information without the user's knowledge such as indicating which page the user was on when they submitted a form.
