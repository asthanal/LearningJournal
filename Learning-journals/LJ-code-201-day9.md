Today I learned about how to look at errors in Chrome. In fact I used breakpoints to step through my code. I used the chrome tools to both step into a function call as well as step out of a function call that I had stepped into. I felt that this was extremely helpful in understanding the way the script was executing. I haven't tried inserting conditional breakpoints but I will try doing so, so that I can take better control of my code. Also, learning about the different types of errors such as SyntaxError, ReferenceError, TypeError, etc. was really helpful. I will pay more attention to the type of error that I get in my console to understand what I need to look at more specifically.
