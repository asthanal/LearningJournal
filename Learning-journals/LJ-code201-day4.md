Today I did a my class reading. Some part of it seemed easy to remember while other parts of it seemed a little overwhelming. For instance, understanding the differences between the various types of 'positioning' made me wonder the varied instances when one would choose one over the other. I feel that once I start actually using these different positioning in my code, I will have a much better grasp of their usage because ultimately theoritical reading can only be strengthened with practical experience. I also enjoyed reading the various examples that the author had put in both the books to explain concepts.
