## Today I read about local storage and CSS transforms and transitions.
I really enjoyed reading about the 8 simple ways to wow your user with CSS. It was nice to look at the examples and see that how the transition properties such as Fade in and growing and shrinking an element with CSS's transform can make a big different in the look and feel of your web page. In my future projects I would like to use some of the examples they have given to enhance your code. I also learned about local storage and how it has evolved over time. I learned that currently we use HTML5 storage which offers 5 megabytes of storage. The article was an interesting read though some of it I didn't really understand very clearly. I think once I start using storage in my code then I will get a better understanding of it.
