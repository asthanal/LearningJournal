Today I learned about the canvas element which differes from the img element as it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. It only has width and height attributes. The canvas element creates a fixed-size drawing surface that exposed one or more rendering contexts, which are used to create and manipulate the content shown. The canvas is initially blank and a script is first needed to access the rendering context and draw on it. It has a method called getContext(), which obtains the rendering context and its drawing functions. I also learned that if the renderings seem distorted one should specify the width and height attribute explicity in the canvas attribute and not using CSS. Additionally if browsers don't support canvas they will ignore the content inside the container and just render the fallback content inside it.
