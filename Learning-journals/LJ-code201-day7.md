Today I learned about tables, whcih represent information in grid format. It was interesting to learn how the basic table structure can be created and manipularing using colspan and rowspan. As far as the DOM model is created I am still trying to understand all of its properties and methods, and trying to figure out how I can use them for my salmon cookie project effectively. I feel that I still need to re-read concepts to fully comprehend them.
