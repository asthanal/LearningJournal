Today, I learned that there are different ways that color can be specified in using CSS such as via the rgb values, or the hex codes or by color names. It was interesting to know that there are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by a browser. I also learned how text can be manipulated to impact the appearance of a webpage. For instance, Kerning can be used to control the space between each letter with the letter-spacing property. This is especially useful when your heading or sentence is in upper case. Seeing the example in the text really brought it to my notice the value of using kerning. I look forward to using it in a program some day.
