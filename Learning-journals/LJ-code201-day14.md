#                          Learning Journal - Day 14
I am really relieved that the 301 entrance exam is over. I had to type out almost everything in the console to test the logic, so it really took time. I really want to thank Rachel, Chris and Sharmarke for helping me learn so much in 201. Tim was also very helpful but I didn't interact with him that much. I know that there is still so much more to know but it always very nice when you have someone much more knowledgeable than you give pointers and help explain the logic. I would have been totally lost without all of your support. Now, I am looking forward to the project week and hope that everything works out fine for everyone in the group. I have been working on the pair programming project of adding an order form and shopping cart to the busmall lab and it is definitely interesting to see how everything ties in together. Rachel's class example was a big help though am still figuring out the logic.
