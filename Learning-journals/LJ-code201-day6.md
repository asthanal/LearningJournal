Today, I learned about the DOM, which specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. I found it really interesting to learn that a browser stores a model of a web page called DOM tress in its memory. I like the fact that I am also getting to learn the different complexities of what happens behind the scene when a web page is uploaded in a browser. I felt that the book was good in giving examples to help the reader understand the different nodelists and the properties and methods associated with each.
